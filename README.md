mp3join
=======

With a few adaptations it can be used to make an online mp3join app. Originally crafted for personal project.<br>
This project combines other open projects such as <code>mp3file.php</code>, <code>phpmp3.php</code> and <code>jquery.bsmselect.js</code>. Check
their license if you have any doubt.<br>
# How it works
Put some mp3 files in the <code>input</code> folder. Then use the officium2mp3.php file to join these mp3 in the 
chosen order. Output (final mp3 file) will appear in the <code>output</code> folder.<br>
Note/Limitation: Final mp3 will have corrupted mp3 id-tag.
